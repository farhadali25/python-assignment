        "#1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "->  The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are foundational principles that guide the design and development of software using objects. These concepts promote code reusability, modularity, and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "- Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is typically achieved through access modifiers (private, public, protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",

        "    def get_name(self):\n",

        "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
        "        self.__name = name\n",
        "Accessing __name directly outside the class is restricted.\n",
        "###2. **Abstraction**\n",
        "- Definition: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To reduce complexity and allow the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.\n",
        "\n",

        "Shape is an abstract class, and its method area() must be implemented by derived classes.\n",
        "###3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "- Definition: Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n",

        "- Purpose: To promote code reuse and establish a relationship between different classes.\n",

        "Car inherits properties from Vehicle and extends it by adding its own attributes.\n",
        "###4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "- Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows methods to be redefined or overridden.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To enable a single interface to represent different types of objects or methods.\n",
