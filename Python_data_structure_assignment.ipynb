        "->  String slicing in Python allows you to extract a portion (or substring) of a string by specifying a start, stop, and optional step value within square brackets. This is an incredibly useful tool for data manipulation and processing, as it lets you focus on specific segments of a string.\n",

        "Lists are a versatile and commonly used data structure in Python that allows you to store and manipulate an ordered collection of items. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Ordered Collection\n",
        "Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added.\n",
        "This means that elements have a specific position (index) in the list, starting from 0 for the first element.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(fruits[0])  # Output: 'apple'\n",
        "###2. Mutable (Can Be Modified)\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
        "###3. Heterogeneous Elements\n",
        "Lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "random_list = [42, \"hello\", 3.14, [1, 2, 3]]\n",
        "###4. Dynamic Size\n",
        "Python lists can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed, which makes them flexible to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "###5. Supports Various Built-in Methods\n",
        "Python provides a wide range of built-in methods for lists, such as append(), remove(), sort(), reverse(), count(), index(), and more, which help in easily managing and manipulating list elements.\n",

        "\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",

        "\n",
        "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
        "\n",
        "###6. Supports Slicing and Indexing\n",
        "Lists support indexing to access individual elements and slicing to access a sub-list or specific range of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(numbers[1:4])  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "###7. Nesting Capabilities\n",
        "Lists can contain other lists as elements, enabling the creation of nested structures or multidimensional lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6\n",
        "###8. Iterable\n",
        "Lists are iterable, meaning you can loop through the elements using a for loop or other iteration methods.\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "for fruit in [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]:\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "###9. Comprehensions for Compact Expressions\n",
        "Python supports list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables.\n",
        "####Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]\n",

        "####List:\n",
        " Lists are mutable, meaning that their contents can be changed after creation. You can add, modify, and delete elements in a list.\n",
        "####Tuple:\n",
        " Tuples are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be modified. You cannot add, modify, or remove elements in a tuple.\n",

        "\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "###3. Usage and Purpose:\n",
        "####List:\n",
        " Lists are generally used when you have a collection of items that may need to be modified, such as adding or removing elements. They’re commonly used for tasks that require dynamic storage.\n",
        "####Tuple:\n",
        " Tuples are used when you have a collection of items that should not be changed, such as coordinates, fixed settings, or database records. They are often used to represent structured, \"write-protected\" data.\n",
        "###4. Performance:\n",
        "####List:\n",
        "Lists have a slightly higher memory overhead due to their mutable nature, making operations like iteration and access somewhat slower compared to tuples.\n",
        "####Tuple:\n",

        "####List:\n",
        " Lists have more built-in methods such as append(), extend(), remove(), and pop(), allowing for flexible manipulation.\n",
        "####Tuple:\n",

        "### #Tuple unpacking\n",
